Java vrpn server
=========

This is a minimalistic & easy-to-use vrpn library for java,
providing the possibility to host a button server with an "unlimited" amount of buttons,
and as many analogs as you wish.

It's based on the comp523android code from the official vrpn release, packed up to be used as a Java library.
